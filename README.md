# Flowbellum-Analysis of wind turbine inspired turbine rotating due to the weight of its own blade


This project is inspired by wind turbines, but instead of using wind to power the blades, it uses the weight of fluid in the blades to produce torque. This means that the turbine does not need any external force to rotate, and it can operate in any environment. The planetary gearbox increases the speed of the generator shaft, which is then used to generate electricity. The blades rotate at a constant speed, which makes the turbine more efficient.

A self-starting darrieus-type windmill by M.N. Nahas proposes a new design for a Darrieus-type windmill that can start on its own, even at low wind speeds. This eliminates the need for external starting mechanisms, which can save money and make the windmill more reliable.

Study on a piezo-windmill for energy harvesting by Junwu Kan describes a new type of windmill that uses piezoelectric materials to generate electricity. Piezoelectric materials generate a voltage when they are deformed, so the windmill can generate electricity even in low-wind conditions.

Multiscale Analysis of Wind Velocity, Power Output and Rotation of a Windmill by Olmo Duran analyzes the relationship between wind speed, power output, and rotation speed in windmills. The paper found that there are multiple optimal wind speed ranges for windmills to achieve peak power output.

Design of wind turbine blade material for higher efficiency by K.P.M.T.V. Dathu discusses the use of lightweight materials in wind turbine blades. The paper found that using lightweight materials can improve the efficiency of wind turbines by reducing the weight of the blades.

These research papers provide insights into the design and operation of windmills, and they can help to improve the efficiency of windmills. The project you are working on is inspired by these research papers, and it has the potential to improve the efficiency of windmills even further.

The current model of wind turbines has some limitations, including:

Inconsistent wind speeds: The amount of wind available can vary greatly depending on the location and time of year. This can make it difficult to generate a consistent amount of power from wind turbines.
Land use: Wind turbines can take up a significant amount of land, which can be a problem in areas with limited space.
Regional suitability: Wind turbines are not suitable for all regions. They are most effective in areas with strong and consistent winds.
These limitations can make it difficult to use wind turbines as a reliable source of power. However, there are a number of research projects underway to address these limitations. These projects are exploring ways to make wind turbines more efficient, less land-intensive, and more suitable for a wider range of regions.

The main disadvantage of conventional wind turbines is that the speed of the wind is unpredictable, so the rotation speed of the turbine is also unpredictable. This makes it difficult to generate a constant amount of power from wind turbines.

Our proposed turbine uses the weight of a body to rotate the turbine, which is constant in nature. This means that the rotation speed of the turbine can be predicted to be constant, which makes it easier to generate a constant amount of power.

We have simulated the model in Solidworks and the results show that the turbine can rotate successfully. The advantage of our turbine is that it can be installed in any place, regardless of the wind speed. This makes it a more reliable source of energy than conventional wind turbines.

Our turbine is a renewable source of energy, which is important in the fight against climate change and global warming. As students, we believe that it is our responsibility to help address these issues, and this project is our contribution to that effort.
